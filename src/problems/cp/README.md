# Challenges & Competitive Programming
Competitive programming or CP is a mind sport where participants need to write efficient programs to solve specific problems. Those problems are often related to algorithms, data structures, math and logic. The programs are judged by the time and space they take. It usually goes as follows: write some program that take an input, process it and outputs a result.

## How to start competitive programming
- [ ] Learn C++ ([General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o), [Pointers](https://youtu.be/zuegQmMdy8M?si=7Bh8U5PabXXx7cK-))
- [ ] Solve [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC) problems sorted by difficulty. If you're stuck, check tutorial at right of problem description. 
Another option is [AtCoder Beginner Contests](https://atcoder.jp/home) (**ABC**). Once ABCs become too easy move on to **ARCs** (AtCode Regular Contests) and then **AGCs**.
- [ ] Simultaniously read the book [The Competitive Programmer Handbook](./docs/the-cp-handbook.pdf)

## Tips
- Spend 5% time reading and the rest solving problems
- Don't compare yourself to others
