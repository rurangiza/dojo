#### How to start competitive programming
- [ ] Learn C++ ([General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o), [Pointers](https://youtu.be/zuegQmMdy8M?si=7Bh8U5PabXXx7cK-))
- [ ] Solve [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC) problems sorted by difficulty. If you're stuck, check tutorial at right of problem description. 
Another option is [AtCoder Beginner Contests](https://atcoder.jp/home) (**ABC**). Once ABCs become too easy move on to **ARCs** (AtCode Regular Contests) and then **AGCs**.
- [ ] Simultaniously read the book [The Competitive Programmer Handbook](./docs/the-cp-handbook.pdf)
