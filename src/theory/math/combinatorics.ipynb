    "# Combinatorics\n",
    "> Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that studies how to count, arrange, and combine objects according to specific rules.\n",
    "> It's often about finding the number of different ways to arrange a set of items, like how many different ways you can line up some books on a shelf or how many different groups of students you can form from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Arithmetic**: Understanding *operations like addition, multiplication, and factorial* (e.g., 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1).\n",
    "2. **Algebra**: Basic skills in *manipulating equations* and understanding variables and coefficients.\n",
    "3. **Set Theory**: Knowledge of *how sets work*, including concepts like unions, intersections, and subsets, which are crucial for understanding how different combinations can be formed.\n",
    "4. **Probability**: Basic principles of probability are often intertwined with combinatorial problems, especially in determining the likelihood of specific combinations occurring.\n",
