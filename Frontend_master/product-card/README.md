## My process
As foundation, I started by defining the HTML structure of the component
I divided the component in two main <div>, one for the cover image, the other for the description of the product. 
The cover image did not need more sections inside but for the description, I would need at last 5 HTML tags:
1. Product tag
2. Title
3. Text description
4. Pricing infos
5. "add to cart" button
Once I had the structure I wanted, I placed the card in the middle of the screen using flexbox and the auto property.
Once that was done, I started applying some CSS.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
