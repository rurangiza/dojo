# Static Site Generator
> The goal of this project is to create a static site generator. Which serves the purpose of converting Markdown text to HTML.

### Why you ask?
Because writing vanilla HTML is tedious. Markdown is more suited when writing regular text while providing formating features like headings, quotes, images,.. in short nearly everything HTML offers but in a more enjoyable setting.
