## Data Structures & Algorithms
> Data structures and algorithms help organize and process data efficiently. Data structures optimize storage and operations for specific needs, algorithms provide methods for tasks like sorting and searching. Understanding them is essential for developing efficient, scalable software, enabling developers to tackle complex problems and create faster, resource-effective applications.

- [x] Watch: [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/live/4oqjcKenCH8?si=58ALyCO1klKIUVnm)
> For each data structure and algorithm, learn the theory and concepts, implement it in code then solve related problems.

### üîó Building, Building and Building! 

- [ ] Building for learning:
    - [ ] **To Do App** ‚Äî start with some basic CRUD application to learn how to setup an app and work with the database. Challenge yourself and add authentication and user permissions.
    - [ ] **Ecommerce website** ‚Äî Along with basic CRUD and Authentication that most eCommerce site‚Äôs will need, you‚Äôll learn more about complex database relationships when it comes to adding Products, Orders, Tags and more. Building an eCommerce site will teach you a lot about designing your models and complex queries. Let‚Äôs also add search, pagination and user roles to that equation.
    - [ ] **Social Network** ‚Äî A social network will also force you to learn about designing your database. For example, how would you build out the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù feature‚Äôs? What about likes and determining what post a user will see in their feed.

### üöÄ Ready, set, deploy!
Now that you have a functional full-stack web app, here is how to make it available to everyone else on the internet.
- **Rent a Server**: This typically means purchasing hosting from a service provider. Options include:
    - [shared hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service)
    - [virtual private servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (VPS)
    - or [dedicated servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service).

    Services: [02Switch](https://www.o2switch.fr/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/)
- **Upload your files**: adding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, to your server using FTP, SSH, or a web-based interface provided by your host.
- **Buy a Domain Name**: Register a domain name through a domain registrar. This will be the address that users type into their browser to access your site.
    Services: [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/)
- **Associate the Domain Name to the Server**: This involves configuring DNS settings to point your domain name to the IP address of your server, usually by setting A or CNAME records through your domain registrar‚Äôs panel.

    > *For me ideas are very important. Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important thing people can do. And I think that great ideas in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories,.. these things take on life of their own and give meaning to our lives.*
    ***Bret Victor** in [Inventin on Principle](https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?t=72)
    
    > Bret's principles: 
        1. C*reators need an immediate connexion to what they're creating to know what feels right. ‚ÄúSo much of creation is discovery and you cannot discover anything if you don't see what you're doing‚Äù*

    > Ideas start out tiny, weak and fragile. In order to develop and mature, they need an environment where the creator can work with them, take care of them, feed them, let them grow. 

    > *Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea whose Time has Come*
    ***Victor Hugo**, The Future of Man*

    > *For years, words on a page were the best way to spread ideas across space and time.* *David Perell, [Tools for Thought](https://perell.com/note/tools-for-thought/)*
