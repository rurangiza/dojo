## Data Structures & Algorithms
> Data structures and algorithms help organize and process data efficiently. Data structures optimize storage and operations for specific needs, algorithms provide methods for tasks like sorting and searching. Understanding them is essential for developing efficient, scalable software, enabling developers to tackle complex problems and create faster, resource-effective applications.

- [x] Watch: [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/live/4oqjcKenCH8?si=58ALyCO1klKIUVnm)
> For each data structure and algorithm, learn the theory and concepts, implement it in code then solve related problems.

#### 🔗 [Connecting the front-end to the back-end](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68164444/how-to-connect-backend-and-frontend)
- [ ] Build full-stack web apps
    - [ ] **To Do App** — start with some basic CRUD application to learn how to setup an app and work with the database. Challenge yourself and add authentication and user permissions. Try building it twice, one with function based views and one with class based views.
    - [ ] **Ecommerce website** — Along with basic CRUD and Authentication that most eCommerce site’s will need, you’ll learn more about complex database relationships when it comes to adding Products, Orders, Tags and more. Building an eCommerce site will teach you a lot about designing your models and complex queries. Let’s also add search, pagination and user roles to that equation.
    - [ ] **Social Network** — A social network will also force you to learn about designing your database. For example, how would you build out the “friends” or “following” feature’s? What about likes and determining what post a user will see in their feed.

    > *For me ideas are very important. Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important thing people can do. And I think that great ideas in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories,.. these things take on life of their own and give meaning to our lives.*
    ***Bret Victor** in [Inventin on Principle](https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?t=72)
    
    > Bret's principles: 
        1. C*reators need an immediate connexion to what they're creating to know what feels right. “So much of creation is discovery and you cannot discover anything if you don't see what you're doing”*

    > Ideas start out tiny, weak and fragile. In order to develop and mature, they need an environment where the creator can work with them, take care of them, feed them, let them grow. 

    > *Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea whose Time has Come*
    ***Victor Hugo**, The Future of Man*

    > *For years, words on a page were the best way to spread ideas across space and time.* *David Perell, [Tools for Thought](https://perell.com/note/tools-for-thought/)*
