          <h1>Xerox Alto: The first computer with a graphical operating system</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="page-content">
          <p>It was conceived in 1972 in a memo written by Butler Lampson, inspired by the oN-Line System (NLS)
            developed by Douglas Engelbart and Dustin Lindberg at SRI International (SRI). Of further influence was the
            PLATO education system developed at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of
            Illinois.[11] The Alto was designed mostly by Charles P. Thacker. Industrial Design and manufacturing was
            sub-contracted to Xerox, whose Special Programs Group team included Doug Stewart as Program Manager, Abbey
            Silverstone Operations, Bob Nishimura, Industrial Designer. An initial run of 30 units was produced by Xerox
            El Segundo (Special Programs Group), working with John Ellenby at PARC and Doug Stewart and Abbey
            Silverstone at El Segundo, who were responsible for re-designing the Alto's electronics. Due to the success
            of the pilot run, the team went on to produce approximately 2,000 units over the next ten years.</p>
          <p>Several Xerox Alto chassis are now on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California,
            one is on display at the Computer Museum of America in Roswell, Georgia, and several are in private hands.
            Running systems are on display at the System Source Computer Museum in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Charles P.
            Thacker was awarded the 2009 Turing Award of the Association for Computing Machinery on March 9, 2010, for
            his pioneering design and realization of the Alto.[13] The 2004 Charles Stark Draper Prize was awarded to
            Thacker, Alan C. Kay, Butler Lampson, and Robert W. Taylor for their work on Alto.</p>
          <p>On October 21, 2014, Xerox Alto's source code and other resources were released from the Computer History
            Museum.[15]
